# ACKme WiConnect WebApp

##Getting Started
See [Setup](docs/setup.md) documentation for brief setup tasks.

## Installation

The WiConnect WebApp uses the following development tools:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)
* [Bower](http://bower.io)

To develop, build or run the WebGUI on your local machine, these will need to be installed. Instructions for installation of these tools:

* [Windows](docs/windows-install.md)
* [Linux](docs/linux-install.md)

After pulling the repo, run the following commands in a terminal to download and install required packages:
```
bower install
npm install
```

## Development Testing

To sucessfully communicate with a remote device, the WiConnect variable `http.server.cors_origin` needs to be set as described by the [WiConnectJS documentation](https://github.com/ackme/WiConnectJS).

If a grunt task fails to run and an error about missing packages is displayed, you may need to run `npm install` to install any missing packages.

```
grunt
```

Will run a local nodejs server on port 5002 (by default - see Development Options) for testing.

```
grunt watch
```

Will start a task that listens for file changes, and compile/compress HTML, CSS and JS

### Development Options

#### Config.json

Edit `config.json` to specify the `localIP` address and `port` for running a development server, remote device IP address for the device to communicate with.

The WiConnect WebApp has been primarily developed using [Jade templating](http://jade-lang.com/) and [LESS CSS pre-processing language](http://lesscss.org/)

#### `no-jade`

If you are unfamiliar with Jade and wish to write traditional HTML run the following grunt task:

```
runt no-jade
```

This will create the files `public/html/index.html` and `public/html/unauthorized.html` for development.

_Note: Running this grunt task again will overwrite any changes made to `index.html` and `unauthorized.html`_

#### `no-less`

If you are unfamiliar with LESS and wish to write traditional CSS run the following grunt task:

```
grunt no-less
```

This will create the file `public/css/wiconnect.css` for development.

_Note: Running this grunt task again will overwrite any changes made to `wiconnect.css`_


## Build / Compile

```
grunt build
```

Compiled and compressed JS, CSS and HTML files will be exported to `/out`

Version, git hash, and build date information are automatically built into the complied JS as an object named `_webgui` for debugging purposes. To view the version/hash/build-date for reporting a bug, open the developer console in your browser, and type `_webgui` and press enter to view the current webgui version/hash/build-date information.

If the files `public/html/index.html` and `public/html/unauthorized.html` exist, they will be used in the build process, and the changes to the jade files will be ignored.

If the file `public/css/wiconnect.css` exists, it will be used in the build process, and the changes to the less files will be ignored.

## Deploy

````
grunt deploy
````

Put webapp files onto the device specified in `config.json`. This requires a server, the default `grunt` task to alread be running in another terminal.

## Release

```
grunt release:[type]
```

Release an official major|minor|patch verion.
When the task is run, the project version is updated and the release will be committed and tagged with the appropriate version, and all files packaged into `/out/release/Release-[version].zip`

Appropriate uses of the release task:
```
grunt release:major
grunt release:minor
grunt release:patch
```
